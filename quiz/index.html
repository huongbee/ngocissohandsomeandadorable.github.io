            <b>PASSAGE 1 — Questions 1-10</b><br />We always went to Ireland in June. Ever since the four of us began to
            go on holidays together we had spent the first fortnight of the month at Glencom Lodge in County Antrim.
            It’s a large house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who
            bought the house, the Malseeds, have had to add to the building, but everything has
            been done most discreetly.
            <br /><br />
            It was Strafe who found Glencorn for us. He’d <mark>come across</mark> an advertisement in the
            days when the Malseeds still felt the need to advertise. ‘How about this?’ he said one
            evening and read out the details. We had gone away together the summer before, to a
            hotel that had been recommended by friends, but it hadn’t been a success because the
            food was so appalling.
            <br /><br />
            The four of us have been playing cards together for ages, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia and
            myself. They call me Milly, though strictly speaking my name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko
            picked up his nickname at school, Dekko Deacon sounding rather good, I suppose. He
            and Strafe were at school together, which must be why we call Strafe by his surname as the teachers used to.
            We're all about the same age and live quite close to the town where
            the Malseeds were before they decided to make the change from England to Ireland.
            Quite a <mark>coincidence</mark>, we always think.
            <br /><br />
            ‘How very nice,’ Mrs Malseed said, smiling her welcome again this year. Some
            instinct seems to tell her when guests are about to arrive, for she’s rarely not waiting in
            the large, low-ceilinged hall that always smells of flowers. ‘Arthur, take the luggage up,’
            she commanded the old porter. ‘Rose, Tulip, Lily and Geranium.’ She referred to the
            names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs Malseed herself painted flowers on the doors
            of the hotel instead of putting numbers. In winter, when no one much comes to Glencom
            Lodge, she sees to little details like that; her husband <mark>sees to</mark> redecoration and repairs.
            <br /><br />
            ‘Well, well, well,’ Mr Malseed said, now entering the hall through the door that leads
            to the kitchen. ‘A hundred thousand welcomes,’ he greeted us in the Irish manner. He
            was smiling broadly with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us think we were rather
            more than just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could feel the others
            thinking that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn, all was
            well. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ‘You look younger every year, all
            four of you,’ she said, causing everyone in the hall to laugh again. Arthur led the way to
            the rooms, carrying as much of our luggage as he could manage and returning for the
            remainder.

            <b>PASSAGE 2 — Questions 11-20</b> <br>How does a person become an Olympic champion — someone capable of
            winning the
            gold? In reality, a combination of biological, environmental, and psychological factors,
            as well as training and practice, all go into making a super athlete.
            <br /><br />
            <b>[A]</b> Perhaps the most important factor involved in becoming an elite athlete is
            genetics. Most Olympic competitors are equipped with certain physical characteristics
            that differentiate them from the average person. Take an elite athlete’s muscles, for
            example. In most human skeletal muscles (the ones that make your body move), there are
            fast-twitch fibers and slow-twitch fibers. Fast-twitch fibers help us move quickly. Olympic
            weightlifters, for example, have a large number of fast-twitch fibers in their muscles —
            many <mark>more</mark> than the average person. These allow them to lift hundreds of kilos from the
            ground and over their heads in seconds. Surprisingly, a large, muscular body is not the
            main requirement to do well in this sport. It is more important to have a large number of
            fast-twitch fibers in the muscles.
            <br /><br />
            The legs of an elite marathon runner, on the other hand, might contain up to 90
            percent slow-twitch muscle fibers. These <mark>generate</mark> energy efficiently and enable an athlete
            to control fatigue and keep moving for a longer period of time. When we exercise long
            or hard, it's common to experience tiredness, muscle pain, and difficulty breathing.
            These feelings are caused when the muscles produce high amounts of lactate and can’t
            remove it quickly enough. Athletes with many slow-twitch muscle fibers seem to be able
            to clear the lactate from their muscles faster as they move. Thus, the average runner might
            start to feel discomfort halfway into a race. A trained Olympic athlete, however, might
            not feel pain until much later in the competition. <b>[B]</b>
            <br /><br />
            <b>[C]</b> For some Olympic competitors, size is important. Most male champion swimmers
            are 180 cm (six feet) or taller, allowing them to reach longer and swim faster. For both
            male and female gymnasts, though, a smaller size and body weight mean they can move
            with greater ease, and are less likely to suffer damage when landing on the floor from a
            height of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
            <br /><br />
            <b>[D]</b> Those raised at high altitudes in countries such as Kenya, Ethiopia, and Morocco
            have blood that is rich in hemoglobin. Large amounts of hemoglobin carry oxygen around
            the body faster, enabling these athletes to run better. Cultural factors also help some
            athletes do well at certain sports. Tegla Loroupe, a young woman from northern Kenya,
            has won several marathons. She attributes some of her success to her country’s altitude
            (she trains at about 2,400 meters, or 8,000 feet) and some to her cultural background.
            As a child, she had to run ten kilometers to school every day. “I’d be punished if I was
            late,” she says.
            <br /><br />
            Although genetics, environment, and even culture play a part in becoming an elite
            athlete, training and practice are needed to succeed. Marathon runners may be able to
            control fatigue and keep moving for long periods of time, but they must train to reach
            and maintain their goals. Weightlifters and gymnasts perfect their skills by repeating the
            same motions again and again until they are automatic. Greg Louganis, winner of four
            Olympic diving gold medals, says divers must train the same way to be successful: “You
            have less than three seconds from takeoff until you hit the water, so it has to be reflex. You
            have to repeat the dives hundreds, maybe thousands, of times.” Training this way requires
            an athlete to be not only physically fit but psychologically healthy as well. “They have to
            be.” says Sean McCann, a sports psychologist at the Olympic Training Center in the U.S.
            “Otherwise, they couldn’t handle the training loads we put on them. Athletes have to be
            good at setting goals, generating energy when they need it and managing anxiety.”

            <b>PASSAGE 3 — Questions 21-30</b> </br>At the end of the 1800's, Thomas Edison introduced the incandescent
            light bulb and
            changed the world. Remarkably, the incandescent bulb used today has changed little in
            over a hundred years. An incandescent light consists of a glass bulb filled with an inert
            gas such as argon. Inside the bulb, electricity passes through a metal filament. Because
            of resistance, the filament becomes so hot that it glows. But 95% of the energy goes to
            produce heat and is basically wasted. Given that 20% of the world’s electricity is used
            to power lights, this represents an enormous amount of wasted energy.
            <br /><br />
            In the 1940’s a new, more efficient form of lighting, the fluorescent bulb, was
            introduced. Fluorescents work by passing electrical current through gas in a tube,
            producing invisible ultraviolet light. A phosphor coating on the inside of the tube then
            converts the ultraviolet to visible light. Little heat is wasted. Fluorescents have proved
            popular in offices, factories, and stores, but they never took over the residential lighting
            market. The harsh color isn’t as pleasing as the warmer glow of incandescent lamps.
            Besides, they have a tendency to flicker on and off and to produce an annoying buzz.
            <br /><br />
            Now, lighting engineers are developing a new form of lighting that is both pleasing
            to the eyes and energy efficient. This is the lightemitting diode, or LED. LEDs are made up
            of layers of electron-charged substances. When an electrical current passes through the
            layers, electrons jump from one layer to another and give off light without producing heat.
            Different types of materials result in light of different colors. Red, green, and orange LEDs have been used
            for decades in devices such as digital clocks, calculators, and electronic
            toys. In the future, however, whitelight-emitting diodes (WLEDs) may be used to light
            homes. Engineers say that <mark>they</mark> are significantly more efficient than either incandescent
            or fluorescent lights.
            <br /><br />
            The next challenge for researchers is to develop an efficient, bright, inexpensive
            WLED. A few years ago, a Japanese scientist named Shuji Nakamura discovered that,
            by using layers of gallium nitride, he could create a powerful blue LED. Later, engineers
            devised two ways to use this blue LED to create a WLED. Red, green, and blue LEDs
            can be combined, creating a pleasant white light. Another way is to use a chemical
            coating similar to that inside a fluorescent bulb that converts the blue light to white.
            Nevertheless, it will still be some time before WLEDs are commonly used in homes. WLEDs
            are currently only twice as energy efficient as incandescent. They are also very expensive.
            But researchers believe that they can create WLEDs that are ten times as efficient and one
            thousand times as long-lasting as incandescent lights, making them cost effective.
            <br /><br />
            LEDs may someday have an even greater impact on developing countries than in the
            developed world. Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people lack access to electricity.
            Lighting is usually provided by kerosene lamps. Kerosene is expensive, creates indoor
            pollution, does not provide very bright light, and worst of all, causes many fires. A low-
            energy (1-watt) WLED can provide enough light for a person to read by — more light, in
            fact, than most kerosene lamps. An entire rural village could be lighted with less energy
            than that used by a single <mark>conventional</mark> 100-watt light bulb. Energy to light these efficient
            LEDs can be provided by batteries that are charged by pedal-driven generators, by
            hydroelectricity from rivers or streams, by wind-powered generators, or by solar energy.

            <b>PASSAGE 4 — Questions 31-40</b> An important part of marketing is determining what price to charge
            consumers for
            goods and services. Companies <mark>aspire</mark> to set prices that are high enough to allow them
            to make a profit but low enough to encourage people to purchase their products. To
            determine these prices, marketing specialists must consider a variety of factors and use a
            number of different pricing approaches.
            <br /><br />
            Costbased approaches determine the price of a product based on how much it costs
            to make. This is the simplest method because manufacturers can easily determine how
            much it will cost them to produce their goods. After they calculate the price of materials
            and labor, they add a set percentage to that cost, called a standard markup, which
            covers advertising, marketing, and other administrative costs, as well as profit. The main advantage to this
            approach is its simplicity. Businesses do not need to adjust their prices
            constantly based on changes in the market for their goods. However, the inability to
            account for important factors relating to the market is also the weakness of the cost-based
            approach. This is why many businesses also use more complex approaches to determine
            their prices.
            <br /><br />
            In many industries, producers often pay less attention to their own costs and set
            prices based on those of their leading competitors instead. This is called competition-
            based pricing. It sometimes puts small businesses at a disadvantage. Because very large
            companies can buy their materials or production machinery in bulk, they often have lower
            production costs than smaller companies do. In order to compete, smaller companies
            cannot depend on costbased pricing. They offen set their prices lower than those of their
            larger competitors, even though their production costs may be higher, in order to make
            their products attractive to consumers and build or maintain their customer base.
            <br /><br />
            While cost-based and competition-based pricing are largely based on <mark>objective</mark>
            mathematical factors, like production costs and average prices, buyer-based approaches
            are based on individual perspective. <b>[A]</b> Perceived value is how much consumers feel
            an item is worth, as opposed to its actual monetary value. <b>[B]</b> For example, a product
            like a pet rock, which is simply an ordinary rock marketed as a pet, has very little actual
            monetary value. <b>[C]</b> Marketers will not use production costs to set their price, because
            this would make the price too low. <b>[D]</b> Instead, they must determine how much consumers
            feel their product is worth.
            <br /><br />
            Because perceived value is subjective, it is difficult to calculate. One common strategy
            for determining the perceived value of a product is to interview people in focus groups,
            small groups of people who share their feelings about a product with market experts. The
            responses of focus groups often change according to the group being interviewed, so
            experts try to interview a large enough sample to get useful information. Along with focus
            groups and market experts, some businesses may even employ psychologists to help
            them understand the minds and emotions of consumers so that <mark>they</mark> can create products
            that people will see as valuable. The more perceived value an item has, the more a
            company can charge for that item, regardless of its production costs or the prices set by
            competitors.
